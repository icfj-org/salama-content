# Digital Security

You need to improve your digital security skills. Your information is at risk of being lost, erased or modified. Critical information might be at risk: identity of your sources, confidential sources, your editorial plans, your contacts information. You may need to protect your information with encrypting tools and good practices. All journalists, whether they work in conflict zones, investigate corruption or cover local politics, need to learn how to encrypt their digital voice and text communications. Media adversaries, whether governments, criminal organizations, corrupt officials or companies, can now easily hack journalists’ communications, learn sources’ identities, obstruct sensitive investigations and even destroy or alter electronic documents.

Aside from particular threats they face, journalists should adopt encryption to fight surveillance and make it harder for their adversaries: if all journalists use encryption, it will be much more expensive for adversaries to spy on all of them than to spy on the few who are currently using these technologies.

Fortunately, technology is on the side of journalists and bloggers. 
Encryption has become an important part of both open source and proprietary communications technology.
