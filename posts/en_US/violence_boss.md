# Improve your communication
You need to significantly improve your communication with your colleagues, both editors and reporters.  It is important to have meetings with them and discuss the best ways for communication when you cover violence. Communication needs to be fluent, confidential and frequent.

You need tools to encrypt your communications via phone calls, text messages, electronic mail or instant messaging. You can use these tutorials and resources:
