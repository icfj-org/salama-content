# Encrypted phone calls

You need to improve the command of digital tools to encrypt your phone calls. Fortunately, journalists may use free open source tools to fight adversaries trying to intercept your phone calls.

**These can be some useful resources for you:**

## Redphone for Android, Signal for iPhone
It is a free open source application that provides end-to-end encryption for voice over IP calls. Adversaries cannot “hear” encrypted conversations. Both tools are developed by Open Whispers Systems. You can use your normal phone number to call sources, editors and colleagues who are using either Redphone or Signal.

Ostel is a free open source that also provides end-to-end encryption to your voice over IP calls. It works over Orbot, providing anomymity to the user.
