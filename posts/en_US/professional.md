# Professional Situation

Journalists need to be professionals at al times. Being professional could save lives, financial resources or psychological wellbeing. You may want to have strong skills in verification methods, always bulletproofing your stories, respect ethics and plan you stories carefully. OCCRP for example recommend journalists who investigate dangerous people to fact-check every bit of data and be very fair. Your sources don’t have to be your friends and the targets of your investigations don’t have to be your personal enemies. Try to avoid putting information that is not essential to your story and can embarrass the target of your investigation.
