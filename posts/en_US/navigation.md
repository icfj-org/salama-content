If you are navigating the Internet and searching for sensitive issues, you may need to protect your digital identity and hide your IP. Using the Tor Browser will allow you to hide your original IP and do not reveal your geographic location. An anonymous navigation on the Internet will also help you to hide the identity of your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

You can download the Tor Browser in:

- [The TorProject website](https://www.torproject.org)

You can access these resources to help you to understand and use the Tor Browser:
