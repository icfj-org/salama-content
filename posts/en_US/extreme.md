You got more than 80 points and probably are under a potential extreme risk. Under this level of risk, damage to physical, psychological, legal or digital security can be severe or catastrophic. Damages may include loss of life, closure of the media organization or an unaffordable financial impact. If such an attack is highly probably to occur, your level of risk will be unacceptable. In that case, your most important goal is to reduce risk immediately, regroup with your organization and take immediate corrective actions. You will probably need to create a new security strategy.
Immediate steps:

- Action 1: Abort any operation that would put you into an imminent risk of suffering physical, psychological, digital, or legal damage in either severe or catastrophic proportions. 

- Action 2: Contact your media organization immediately and discuss potential courses of action. If you are a freelancer, contact your trust network and the media organizations you are working for.

- Action 3: Report to national and/or local authorities about any threat or attempt to attack against you or your media organization and request urgent preventive steps to protect your physical integrity.

- Action 4: Contact immediately any of these organizations and request help:

a) [Committee to Protect Journalists](https://www.cpj.org/campaigns/assistance/how-to-get-help.php)

b) [Reporters Without Borders](http://en.rsf.org/a-hotline-for-journalists-in-17-04-2007,21749.html)

c) [International News Safety Institute](http://www.newssafety.org/contact/ )

d) [Article 19](http://www.article19.org/pages/en/contact-us.html)

e) [Rory Peck Trust](https://rorypecktrust.org/Contact)

- Other courses of action:

-- Create or review your security strategy: A security strategy is a document revised periodically which outlines the major security concerns of a person or media organization and outlines plans to reduce risks and face those concerns. If possible, discuss with your media organization about this situation and analyze together actual and potential threats, vulnerabilities and strengths, and set up new security goals according to the new circumstances.

-- Create or review security protocols. A protocol is a sequence of operations that ensure your physical, psychological, legal or digital security. You will need to create security protocols for each situation, depending of the nature of the threat you are facing and your specific conditions of vulnerability and strength.
