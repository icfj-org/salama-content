You reached more than 60 points and are under a potential high risk. In high levels of risk, journalists may suffer serious physical, psychological, legal or digital damage. Death threats, arbitrary arrests, beatings, cyber-attacks, are examples of these risks. You may conduct a evaluation of any operation which puts you in further risk. In your security plan, you need to add corrective actions and eliminate unacceptable risks. You will probably need to adopt or improve some protocols.

Immediate steps:

- Action 1: Keep contact to your media organization and set a process to discuss courses of action. 

- Action 2: Analyze what is wrong in any operation that is putting you into a high risk to suffer serious physical, psychological, digital, or legal damage.

- Action 3: Report to national and/or local authorities about any threat or attempt to attack you and request urgent preventive steps to protect your physical integrity.

- Action 4: Get familiar to these organizations and informed them about your level of risk

- Other courses of action:

-- Create a security strategy: A security strategy is a document revised periodically which outlines the major security concerns of a person or media organization and outlines plans to reduce risks and face those concerns. 

-- You need to discuss this situation with your media organization. 

-- Conduct an in-depth analysis of the threats you are facing, the main vulnerabilities and strengths you have, and set up new goals according to the new circumstances. 

-- Create security protocols. A protocol is a sequence of operations that ensure your physical, psychological, legal or digital security. You will need to create security protocols for each situation, depending of the nature of the threat you are facing and your specific conditions of vulnerability and strength. Although each protocol should be particular to each condition, there are some operations that might be conducted in most extreme risk situations.
