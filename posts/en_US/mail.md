You may want to protect sensitive information you send in emails and learn how to encrypt information. 

Follow these security advices:

- **Always use HTTPS**. 

Make sure the email provider uses the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).  With this protocol the information is encrypted when in transit from your web browser to the server. If your contact, being a source, a colleague or an editor uses the same protocol, the information will be protected from end to end.
If you are at extreme risk, under a live or death situation, and require privacy, do not transmit information via email at all.
Otherwise, learn how to encrypt information in the body of an email. These are some options:

## OpenPGP

### Pros: 
1. It is based on the classical Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) asymmetric encryption technology. 

2. There is practically no way for an adversary to crack and read a message carefully encrypted with OpenPGP.  

3. Once installed, it is pretty easy to use.

### Cons:  
1. Setting up OpenPGP properly is not very easy. 

2. You need to follow carefully the instructions to install the software. You will have two keys, one private, and one public. 

3. Everybody can have your public key, but only you must have access to your private key. 

4. You can encrypt files with PGP technology.
