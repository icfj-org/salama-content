# Do you cover violence?

You frequently cover violence. It is extremely important to create security protocols for each particular situation and adopt ethical guidelines to cover and interview victims of violence. Avoid personal contact to those actors who use violence to meet their ends. You also need to be in constant touch and communication with your most trusted colleagues. They will be of crucial help if you eventually are in the middle of a violent incident. Develop security protocols that fit your needs in each risk situation. Include in you protocols the ethical treatment of victims of violence during interviews. Get protection gear if you are at risk of suffer violence.

The Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism produced a security manual after hundred of cases of attacks to media staff covering violent protests in Brazil. Some of their advices are valid in other contexts:

- Plan your coverage ahead of time. Is there a safer way to get the information or images necessary? Plan what you will do if you are assaulted, detained or robbed. If you know the protest route, anticipate your escape routes and set them up in advance with your team members.
- Know the social and political context that is motivating the participants: what recent facts preceded the protest, what the general attitude toward media outlets is, what they think about the field you work in; do you have any characteristics that could generate additional risks (such as being a woman in a context that involves the risk of sexual violence); are there groups with a history of violence against journalists?
- Before leaving for the site, take a look, via GPS or the internet, at the terrain where the protest will take place, identifying police stations, places where you can take shelter, escape routes, which way the roads run, elevated locations for good images, dead-end streets, road-blocks, hospitals and reference points for reorganization in case you get separated from your team.
- Calculate how long you and your team will need to be on location in order to get what you need.
- Get the weather report for the coverage period. If necessary, take a waterproof jacket. In some locations, the temperature drops at night. Be prepared. Condoms can be used to keep camera memory cards dry in case there is a torrential downpour or the police use water cannons.
- Keep a constant line of communication open with the newsroom. Set up periodic intervals for sending pre-determined, and if necessary, coded text messages, such as “flat tire” equals “we’ve been detained.” Dozens of messages can be created for all manner of hypothetical situations brought up during the planning phase, put together in a table with a copy in the newsroom.
- Record more than one direct-dial number on your phone for emergencies. Insert the letter “A” at the beginning of these contacts, so that they appear at the top of your contact list. Take a back-up cell phone battery. Reduce the screen brightness and disable unnecessary apps that use up energy. Opt for phones that take two chips. Use chips from two different phone carriers.
- A reporter or assistant should help photojournalists and camera operators, as they will be focused on their job of collecting images. One of the team should maintain a broad view of the entire scene at all times, and be concerned with the team’s safety. Set up these roles in advance.
- If you have a driver, check that he is familiar with the locale, is able to plan escape routes, is always in communication and doesn’t leave the car trapped in inaccessible parking spots.
- If you have asthma, respiratory problems or infections, are pregnant, have lowered immunity, an eye infection, or use contact lenses and don’t have glasses, avoid engaging in coverage of this type. Make sure that you are physically capable of performing the task: Can you run?
- Check that, in case something happens to you, you and your family will have medical and insurance coverage.
- Use identification visible from a distance if you believe this will provide you greater protection. Hide your ID and try to blend in with the people around you if this seems more appropriate. Know how to read the context and mood of the protest participants in regard to the press. Set these procedures up with your team in advance.
- Divide your money into smaller quantities and keep it in different waterproof places on your person or in an additional wallet.
