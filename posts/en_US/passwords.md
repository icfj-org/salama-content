# Secure passwords
Passwords are the first line of defense of our information. You need to take your time to craft a good, strong password for your accounts. It is advisable to have one password per account, so if an adversary is able to crack one password, the rest of your accounts are still protected. If you suspect one of your passwords has been cracked, change immediately and craft another strong password.
