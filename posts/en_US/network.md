# A good communication is essential

A good communication is essential for security. 
Journalists may want to have a good communication with editors, colleagues and trusted networks. 
In fact, the lack of communication is probably one of the biggest vulnerabilities to be exploited by adversaries. A non-efficient communication and understanding between an editor and a reporter may affect a good planning and have a strong impact on preparedness.
A good communication should be an important part of the planning process. All stories should be planned with participation of reporters, editors and other colleagues such as designers, developers, and data experts. Communication is also an important component of the new gathering process.  While reporters always need to be findable, reporters must check in constantly with editors during all the coverage period in extreme and high-risk situations.
