# Threat protocols
Attacks to journalists and bloggers in high-risk zones should be an alert to you. We suggest you to discuss with colleagues what security protocols you should follow to face potential threats. Threats consist in the existence of power groups or individuals that may be affected by the work of the journalist, blogger, or citizen reporter, and have the capability to cause physical, psychological, legal, or digital harm. These threats are no longer potential and become real when these power groups develop the intent to cause harm and devise a plan to inflict it.
To get to know threats well, we must have detailed information on them:

- Name

- Capability (number of people, weapons they have, espionage technology)

- Strengths (support from corrupt rulers, impunity)

- Weaknesses (rivalries with other power groups, susceptibility to public whistleblowing).

- Intent to harm

Digital threats come from power groups interested in finding out the information a journalist holds, preventing access to that information or destroying it. Dmitri Vitaliev, expert on dIgital security, believes that threats of this kind “represent a possibility that someone will harm the security of [our] computers, information stored on them, and the online communications” we carry out. The author mentions cyber viruses, computer confiscation, and website blocking as examples of digital threats. With the advancement of technology, the attack can be directed at such mobile devices as cell phones, laptops, and tablets.
